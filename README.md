**Introduction**

LabLog is an electronic lab notebook (ELN) that can replace or enhance the traditional physical paper based notebook to store all laboratory related information including but not limited to protocols, notes, raw data, and consumable details. Electronic notebooks like LabLog are considered legal documents that can be used in regulated environments or in academic research labs. ELNs make life in the lab run more smoothly increasing efficiency and allowing teams to work together in an organized fashion. LabLog utilizes modular features such as methods, tasks, and inventory for file management, lab notes, team management, signatures, and planning projects. The search option lets users narrow down and find documents, inventory items, or notes that are related. Tags give you the flexibility to group documents together for the search. From creating protocols to performing laboratory tasks, and everything in between â€” LabLog has got you covered.

**Industry vs. Academia**

Both industry and academic laboratories can benefit from LabLog by storing and organizing protocols, notes, and SOPs. Additionally, LabLog helps with keeping track of raw data including attached images, tables, PCR data, and related PDFs by linking to experiments and/or individual protocols. LabLog users can work together in a highly organized environment in real time. LabLog&#39;s integration with Excel means that users can quickly upload their current data and start working with the Excel files right inside their lab notebook. File sharing and version control are automatically taken care of so researchers can focus on working with the data rather than the logistics of file and data management.

There are added benefits for those working in regulated industries. The LabLog team has verified compliance with FDA Part 11 and can provide all necessary documents required for validation and auditing. When adopting LabLog, you can request the assistance of our in-house team of regulatory experts. Our experts can help you set up the correct documentation for validation. We can also help with creating SOPs, and performing impartial audits after implementation.

**Cloud storage for research data**

LabLog offers a native mobile app that can be installed from the Apple and Google app stores. Everything is synched in real-time or whenever the mobile devices comes back online. In addition, when Methods and Tasks are created and shared, information flows transparently throughout LabLog.

The DocuSync feature enables integration with locally installed applications on a user&#39;s computer. This adds the benefits of LabLog&#39;s online capabilities such as version control. DocuSync interacts with the local computer&#39;s file system to launch the default application for editing and viewing specialized files and automatically keeping track of any edits and synching them to the uploaded version in the user&#39;s online lab notebook. This eliminates the need for manual downloading, editing and then uploading files while managing multi-user scenarios. Collaborative efforts are managed by LabLog&#39;s built-in document Check-in/Check-out system to prevent users from overwriting each other&#39;s work.

LabLog allows hierarchical team organization, giving you the flexibility to define and assign roles to each member. Furthermore, team managers can sign documents and review audit logs.

**Save money on consumables**

LabLog&#39;s Inventory Module allows users to import and track all inventory items used in their experiments and day-to-day operations. Users have the ability to progress their inventory through categories or milestones to track not only where each item is used in procedures, but the quantities. This means you can manage all pieces of the project that are essential to your research, including inventory amounts in stock, supporting documentation for inventory items, and tracking equipment.

Other actions like printing barcodes, labels, and more can be done through LabLog&#39;s inventory module allowing for logical and organized inventory management. Users can create freezer boxes and racks for easier storage management and perform searches based on the available space in the stored boxes.
