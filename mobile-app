**Mobile app**

LabLog offers a native mobile app that can be installed from the Apple and Google app stores. Everything is synched in real-time or whenever the mobile devices comes back online. In addition, users can use the web browser on their mobile devices to log in to their digital lab notebook with responsive web pages that allow efficient use on devices with smaller screens.

The mobile app takes advantages of mobile technologies such as push notifications to alert users with any scheduled reminders and a built-in lab timer that eclipses traditional lab timers in terms of functionality and reliability.

While on desktop computers, the Speech-To-Text is available in the Chrome browser and Microsoft Edge, mobile devices uses the native platform services (e.g. Siri) on iPhone and Android devices to allow recording lab notes in the native LabLog mobile app.

Like the desktop version of LabLog, users can attach a variety of file types from a mobile device to the Task or Methods. This includes the option to take a photo or video directly from the smartphone making those hard to explain (in words) moments and details of an experiment easier to communicate.
